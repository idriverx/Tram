Hi there!
Just clone this repository and you can in index.php manage the app. I left usage example in index.php, it will be log results to /logs/tram.log (probably better will be make unique logging file name, but I don't think that is problem (:
Also you can see log examples in /logs/log_example.log
Thank you.

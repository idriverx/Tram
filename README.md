Hi there!
Just clone this repository and you can in index.php manage the app. I left usage example in index.php, it will be log results to logs/ folder
Also you can see log examples in /logs/log_example.log.
**Warning!** If you will get 500 Error, just notice, that in some cases my code throws exceptions. For example, if tram doors are open, they can't by open again without close doors.

**Thank you.**
